Introduction
Customer churn, the phenomenon of customers leaving a service or product, can have a significant impact on a business's bottom line. This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. It involves exploring the data to gain insights and building a predictive model.

Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA notebook contains the exploration of the dataset. It includes data visualization, statistical analysis, and data preprocessing. The EDA process helps in understanding the characteristics of the dataset and identifying patterns that can be useful for building the prediction model.

Model Building
The Model Building notebook focuses on creating predictive models for customer churn. It involves:

Data preprocessing, including feature engineering and handling missing values.
Trying out different machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.
Evaluating the models using appropriate metrics.
Selecting the best-performing model and saving it for future predictions.

Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Lavesh2001/customer-churn-prediction.git
